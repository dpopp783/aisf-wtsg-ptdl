# Towards Understanding the Impact of Pre-training Leakage on Weak-to-Strong Generalization

This repository contains the code used for my final project for BlueDot Impact's AI Safety Fundamentals Alignment Course. The blog post on the initial experiments can be found [here](https://danielpopp.substack.com/p/towards-understanding-the-impact)

The initial experiments were run in a pretty ad-hoc manner, so my next steps is the the development of an easier to use pipeline, with some common functionalities being implemented in `utils.py`.
